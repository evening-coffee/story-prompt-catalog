# Prompt Catalog

 A PHP-based website that catalogs short story ideas into a database

## What is this?

- The prompt catalog is a simple website that allows you to store 75-character long strings of text inside of an SQL database.
- You can then search the catalog by either keyword, ID, or color-tag to find ideas that you can use as writing prompts for your stories.

## Current To-Do List

- Add more functionality to the user registration function, including the creation of user-specific tables and back-up options for password recovery.
- Create session variables that will allow the user to access their own table of information.
- Add in the ability to edit and delete entries from the catalog
- Add in the ability to change the UI accent colors to either purple, red, yellow, green, blue, or gray.
- Change the colors for the color tags to give them a more accessible contrast.
- Validate HTML and CSS, clean up PHP with comments and proper spacing.
- Add a proper folder structure to keep this all clean.

## Wishlist

- Some form of 2FA implimentation would be neat. Not sure how I would approach it, but I like the idea of it. Might be a bit too advanced for my current knowledge of PHP.
